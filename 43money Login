Pew's first-ever nationally representative telephone survey about payday borrowing reveals findings that contradict general perceptions, including:

Who: Most borrowers are employed, white, female, and 25 to 44 years old. However, consumers who disproportionately use these products are those who lack a four-year college degree, are home renters, African-American, earn less than $4,000 per year, or are separated or divorced.

Why: Consumers use payday loans to cover everyday living expenses â€“ not emergencies. Pew found that 69 percent of first-time borrowers needed funds for recurring expenses, such as utilities, credit card bills, or rent or mortgage payments. Only 16 percent sought money for unexpected expenses, such as a medical emergency. If payday loans were not available to them, 81 percent of borrowers reported they would cut back on other expenses instead.
